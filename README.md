# Lendsqr Fe Test

Lendsqr Fe Test is a responsive web application built on React with typescript that allows an admin to login, search and manage both users and app resources. The app currently uses a mock api to pull data and display as users.

This template design was created after observing the test figma file, there was adherence to the design and where neccessary, modifications were made. Missing designs such as responsive screens where implemented, however basic, the site is fully responsive.

## My process

## Built with

-   React
-   BootStrap
-   MUI
-   Semantic HTML Markup
-   SCSS
-   TypeScript

## What I learned

As a process of documenting progress, i include this sectiion in my projects. I learned proper use of react, it's dom, MUI libraries, manipulating state, typed variables and html elements, file structuring and UI/UX techniques.

## Continued development

The project is made to be responsive on all viewport but one thing that i desire more in my project is bringing more life and user engagement to each section and the whole project as whole. To accomplish this, i would be venturing more into calling scss styles using an intersection observer and also mastering the MUI Library(https://mui.com/). Then Three.js would be my next journery.

## Useful resources

-   [MUI - Material Framework](https://mui.com/) - This helped me with easy and useful UI component, styles and animation and tons of amazing funtionalities.

-   [Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com)

-   [React](https://react.dev/) - This (if your not familar with), is a javascript framework built javascript and helps build amazing websites and webapps a lot faster than using raw javascript.

-   [Lendsqr](https://lendsqr.com/) - Uses web apps to reach over half a million customers. At this scale, they use React with TypeScript and SCSS as their frontend software development stack which allows them to rapidly ideate and release features rapidly and reliably.
